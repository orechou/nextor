**Effective Date**: February 12, 2026

## Introduction

Nextor is a modern Markdown editor that values your privacy. This privacy policy explains how Nextor handles your data.

## Data Collection

### Local Data Only
Nextor is designed to work with your files **locally on your device**. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your:
- Documents and files you create or edit
- Personal information
- Usage analytics
- Location data
- Device identifiers

### What We Store Locally
Nextor stores the following information locally on your device only:
- **Application Settings**: Theme preferences (light/dark/system), language preference (English/中文), and other user preferences
- **Recent Files**: List of recently opened files for quick access
- **Window State**: Window size, position, and sidebar state

This data is stored in your application data directory and is never transmitted to any server.

## Network Access

Nextor uses network access only for the following purposes:

1. **Mermaid Diagrams**: Loading the Mermaid.js library from cdn.jsdelivr.net to render diagrams in your Markdown documents
2. **KaTeX for Math**: Loading the KaTeX library from cdn.jsdelivr.net to render mathematical formulas
3. **External Images**: Displaying images hosted on external servers in your Markdown documents

Nextor does not:
- Collect analytics
- Send crash reports
- Check for updates
- Connect to any backend servers

## File Access

Nextor accesses your files only when you explicitly:
- Open a file through the file dialog
- Save a file through the file dialog
- Export a document

All file operations require your explicit action through the native file dialogs. Nextor cannot access your files without your permission.

## Third-Party Services

Nextor uses the following third-party libraries loaded over HTTPS:
- **Mermaid.js** (cdn.jsdelivr.net): For diagram rendering
- **KaTeX** (cdn.jsdelivr.net): For mathematical formula rendering

These libraries are loaded directly to your browser from their public CDNs. We do not control their operations but only use their open-source libraries.

## Data Sharing

Nextor does **not** share any data with third parties. Your documents and personal information never leave your device.

## Data Security

- All data is stored locally on your device
- App Sandbox is enabled (on macOS) to isolate Nextor from other applications
- File access requires explicit user permission through native file dialogs

## Children's Privacy

Nextor is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.

## Your Privacy Rights

Under the GDPR and other privacy regulations, you have the right to:
- Access your data
- Delete your data
- Export your data

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data at all times. You can:
- Delete your local application data at any time
- Export your documents to any location
